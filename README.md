lazypredict training course made specifically for data science lecturer interview (August 2022)

*Developed by Georgina Dangerfield*



### Timings

15 minutes


### Course Summary

So many machine learning models, so little time… Sometimes one of the most difficult tasks in your machine learning project can be actually choosing a model. Enter lazypredict, one of the best python libraries that helps you to semi-automate your machine learning task. It builds a lot of basic models without much code and helps you understand which models work better without any parameter tuning


### Course Objective

The aim of this course is to demonstrate the capabilities of the ‘lazypredict’ Python package and to provide a solid foundation in which to further your learning if required.
 
### Learning Objectives

During the course, learners will:

- Recall the most popular machine learning methods and when they are useful

- Calculate which machine learning model is best using the lazypredict package

- Complete an exercise where learners can experiment with the lazypredict package.


 
### Delivery Methods

This course is designed to be deliverable online, in-person and through self-learning. During online and face-to-face sessions, the trainer will walk through the main notebook with the learners and be able to assist with any queries the learner may have during the exercise.


### Skill Requirements
Learners should have intermediate experience in Python and Machine Learning.
